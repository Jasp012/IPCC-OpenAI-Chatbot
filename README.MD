# üåç IPCC + OpenAI Chatbot

An intelligent chatbot that allows users to ask natural language questions about the IPCC reports using generative AI and semantic search.

---

## üöÄ Project Goal

This project enables interactive exploration of complex scientific documents from the IPCC (specifically the AR6 Synthesis Report) through a conversational interface powered by GPT-3.5/4, LangChain, and FAISS.  
The user asks a question, and the chatbot answers with contextually relevant content extracted directly from the PDF.

## üß† Technologies Used

- **LangChain**: to orchestrate the retrieval pipeline
- **OpenAI API**: for generating responses
- **FAISS**: for semantic vector search
- **PyPDF2**: to read the IPCC PDF
- **Tiktoken**: for token-efficient text chunking
- **(Optional)** Streamlit for a web interface
